its only appropriate for you to take your mistress to Paris ... one day ... it just all comes with the territory for me to be the mistress and for you to have one 😂 

whenever im not thinking about work or like sci/tech, my mind defaults to thinking about art, art history and history ... its like my mental screensaver, usually its about the devastating impact of colonialism on the world but other things too, like how difficult it is in history to make a specific color of paint. i taught myself in middle school how to use adobe illustrator and photoshop like all of it and all by myself and i use to make abstract art ... like spend days making something ... but writing code and just writing is the only creative thing i do now?? maybe baking?? i dunno ... yeah there's that bill gates quote: "the thing you do obsessively between age 13 and 18, that’s the thing you have the most chance of being world-class at" for me it was sci/art/cs (bc i took cs in the 11th+12th grade)

makeup and fashion -- those are two creative things that i like, but i dont like advertising that thats what i like bc there are people out there who only like makeup and fashion and its like they may not be the most productive members of society ?? and i dont want to be associated with that, its like yeah i like this stuff, ive always liked it, but thats not all i like and not all of what i like to do, its a tough tightrope to balance

americans can buy small chateaus in france ... imagine just working from home from there BUT ... BUT they could be haunted bc they could be centuries old lol that would be soo annoying

the french dont care about PDA in a museum ... see that would be an incredibly fun day
