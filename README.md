its only appropriate for you to take your mistress to Paris ... one day ... it just all comes with the territory for me to be the mistress and for you to have one ðŸ˜‚ 

whenever im not thinking about work or like sci/tech, my mind defaults to thinking about art, art history and history ... its like my mental screensaver, usually its about the devastating impact of colonialism on the world but other things too, like how difficult it is in history to make a specific color of paint. i taught myself in middle school how to use adobe illustrator and photoshop like all of it and all by myself and i use to make abstract art ... like spend days making something ... but writing code and just writing is the only creative thing i do now?? maybe baking?? i dunno ... yeah there's that bill gates quote: "the thing you do obsessively between age 13 and 18, thatâ€™s the thing you have the most chance of being world-class at" for me it was sci/art/cs (bc i took cs in the 11th+12th grade)
